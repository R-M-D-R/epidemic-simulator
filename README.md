# epidemic-simulator

This simulates the spread of an infectious disease. To do this, we use bouncing balls to model people moving around. If an infected ball collides with a healthy ball, the healthy ball will become sick. The user can alter four variables to see what happens in the simulation:

-the disease's incubation period (this is the period of time from when a healthy person contracts the disease but exhibits no symptoms--and is contagious!)

-for how long someone is sick

-the mortality rate of the disease (this will be a percent)

-the population size (the default is 100 people)


The information from the model is presented at the top of the screen as a type of stacked area chart. The height of the chart represents 100% of the people, and the different colors represent the proportions of the population (sick, healthy, recovered, dead). Hover your mouse over the chart to obtain more accurate information!

Enjoy!
